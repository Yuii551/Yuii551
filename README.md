🇯🇵 日本語版はこちら → [README_JP.md](README_JP.md)

Hi! I’m **Yi Han**, a Computer Science student specializing in **Game Development**, focusing on **game programming** and **systems design**.  
I build gameplay systems, tools, and prototypes primarily in **Unreal Engine 5**, using a clean hybrid workflow of **C++** and **Blueprints**.  
I’ve also developed several internal UE5 plugins and reusable systems for production use.

## 🛠️ UE5 Experience

### **Gameplay Systems I’ve Built**  
*(Company/internal work — described at a high level)*

- **Inventory System**  
  Modular, data-driven item structures supporting extensions and designer-friendly setup.

- **Pickable System**  
  Framework for picking up world objects, adding them to the inventory, and using or consuming them through a unified interaction flow.

- **Interactable Framework**  
  Component-based system to handle interactions such as pickups, doors, triggers, and inspectable objects.

- **Door System**  
  Reusable logic for opening/closing, state management, and interaction rules.

- **Player Movement Extensions**  
  Additional behaviors such as sprinting, crouching, and custom actions for smoother character control.

### **Plugin & Tools Development**
- Developed reusable **UE5 plugins** packaging gameplay systems  
- C++ used for core frameworks and gameplay tag architecture  
- Blueprints for designer tools and fast iteration  
- Focus on modularity, scalability, and clean interfaces for teammates
